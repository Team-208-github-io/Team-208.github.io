# User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements

**Our Process:**
* To complete user needs analysis, the team met online via Discord. This made sharing screens and files easy. Then we decided that Jamboard would be used to display and consolidate our ideas. Then each team member started to add user needs ideas to the board. No idea was rejected at first, all team members suggested and wrote whatever need they could think of. No team member rejected ideas at this point, this was merely to get a large pool of user needs on the table. Then we organized all the user needs into groups. This helped to reduce the number of repeat user needs in each category. Next, we ranked each section by how much the team valued them. Finally, we ranked every need in each category as well. This gave us a very good idea of what we value and absolutely need in the design. 

## User Needs

1. The main components need to be made of high quality materials\.
2. The design needs to be comfortable for the user to wear for long periods of time\.

41. The device should help stabilize vibrations in the glove to help regulate pressure\.
42. The product can display on\-screen feedback from users after use\.
43. Should come with everything needed to operate the device\.
44. Designers need to understand the center of gravity of the product in the prototype to prevent user fatigue and other discomforts in the process of use\.
45. Product design should take into account the size of the user's hand, or have stretchable materials to facilitate wearing\.

56. Design product features that can be easily accepted by the user's target\.
57. The working principle does not need to be too complicated to facilitate the production and subsequent repair of the product\.
58. The service life of the product should be within the user's ability to accept\.
59.  After the product stops working, the finger movement joints controlled by each part should be returned to the normal position to prevent injury\.
60. In the event of a product failure, the entire circuit system needs to have an emergency treatment plan\.

## Benchmarking 
**Our Process:**
* The team met on Discord again to do the benchmarking. First we agreed that we would look up ideas relating to Parkinson’s or nerve damage therapy relating to the hand. This produced a few different products that the team thought were interesting and helpful. We analyzed the positive and negative comments on each product to get more user needs directly from users.

| “So my Mom has had weakness in her left side for a while. She didn't think this glove was really going to do anything she hadn't already been doing. We started out on the auto exercise for 5 minutes a day on her left hand. It's hard for her to get her left hand to do anything, it doesn't mind and kind of gets grabby on its own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 1.

| After a few days of using this device, Mom found herself reaching for an object with her left hand, just using the power of her mind - you know, like your body should! Every movement she has to do needs to be so mindful, so her brain thinking "I want that object" and sending her left hand, which was closest, to get it is an absolute breakthrough!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 3.

| The glove works through air pressure to make your hand open and close. It doesn't feel weird when it does it, and she really likes that it makes her fingers extend, since that's also an exercise she doesn't do often anymore. You can adjust the intensity, the pressure, and even use the other glove on your right hand to send messages to the left on what you would like it to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                        |

| Obviously, your mileage may vary. Everyone works at their own pace and can only do what they can, but I see how this device can help people relearn to use their hand.

| “What I love about this robot glove is how straight forward it is to use. The different modes and intensity level can easily be changed via the control monitor (orange box). Air pressure can be turned off to a particular finger by the white valves on the glove which makes it easy to isolate a particular finger or fingers for training. What I really love the most is the mirror training glove, genius. The mirror glove is worn on the non-training hand. When I clench the mirror glove and press a button it mimics this movement on the robot glove. This is great for trying to retrain your hand and stimulate movement. The glove works by air compression and is a bit on the loud side when the orange box is pumping air. The control box is cordless so can be taken anywhere without having to rely on an outlet. I appreciate the fact that they actually included a AC USB charger and cable.” | 1. The device allows for various levels of intensity.

| “All other sellers were showing delivery 2+ months later and at higher price. I took a chance here with only 2 review. I am very pleasantly surprised with quick delivery. The product works amazingly well for my brother who suffered a stroke and can’t move left arm/fingers. Even the doctors, nurses and the physical therapists at the hospital are amazed when they see my brother using it while admitted. It’s really helping with his rehabilitation.I am in tech, and am super impressed that someone developed this.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 1.
