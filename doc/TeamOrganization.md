# Team Organization

After reviewing the project requirements and determining the need of potential users for our final product along with what we'd like to learn and get out of the project our team decided upon the goals listed below:

Create a project that is able to capture our audience’s attention during the Innovation Showcase.
Developing a great addition to our engineering portfolios.
Getting experience using industry level tools to create our project.
Create a project that solves/remedies a real world problem.
Create a project that can sense and respond to two or more environmental conditions. 
Increase our knowledge of microcontrollers and interconnecting subsystems.
Increase your proficiency in the use of the software and gain a clear understanding of how each module in MPLAB works and how it works.
Improve team organization and coordination skills and clarify integrated common goals.


* 
_To be successful in our understanding of microcontroller programming while addressing how environmental sensing influences can affect real world applications in our final project._

**Product Mission Statement**

* Based on the project description and project requirements, Team 208 has come up with the following mission statement:

_Our team will create an embedded systems device that senses at least two environmental conditions. This device will have at least one controlled response that reacts based on the sensory data. All sensing and actuation will be accomplished using serial communication. Our device will be used to solve a real world problem and will be demonstrated at the Polytechnic innovation showcase to industry professionals. The team will stay within budget and within the requirements of the 314 course. Some, but not all, of these requirements are surface mount components only, using cadence only, and board communication over wifi._
