**Description:**
This section is used to document the components used in our design. This is very important for the entire team to have access to because our subsystems have to work together. If even one component is incorrectly selected it could ruin or break the project. The table above shows the main components used in our design, but this is far from a comprehensive list, it only includes the most important parts. The rest of the selected components can be found in the appendix.

All parts meet the requirements and unless specified otherwise are surface mounted. Everything from the voltage regulators to the op-amp are surface-mounted. The only parts that aren’t surface mounted are the barrel jack, motor, and wall plug to supply power to the device. A variety of communication methods are utilized such as SPI, UART, and I2C. Our wall power supply supplies voltage at a measurement of 5V and 1A to a switching voltage regulator. From the switching voltage regulator the power drops down and comes out to 3.3 V. Our force sensors are resistive which utilize an ADC device to convert their analog signals to SPI so it can be read by the microcontroller. The ESP32 utilizes UART to communicate all this data over Wi-Fi bidirectionally to a  MQTT server. The server could be potentially on someone’s personal device or the medical records system at a doctor’s office.

| If you have multiple units in your design (e.g., a base unit and remote unit) then you need a separate power budget for each unit 

**Description:**
The power budget is used to estimate how much current all major components use. This gives the team a good idea of how much power each power rail needs. This is espically helpful when selecting the power supply method, components, and values. We concluded in our power budget that the device has adequate current values on each power rail (3.3V and 5V). There is a 25% safety margin on the currents as well to account for sudden drops in current for any reason.
