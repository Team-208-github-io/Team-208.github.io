Team 208 has undertaken the development of a glove that aims to assist individuals with neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and tremors, who may experience difficulty accurately sensing pressure and temperature. Such individuals may inadvertently apply excessive pressure while holding objects, without being able to accurately perceive their grip strength. The proposed glove seeks to restore a sense of independence and agency to these individuals by providing them with a means to regain control over their grip and temperature sensing abilities. The ultimate goal is to design a wearable device that can be used both in clinical rehabilitation settings and in daily life.

The proposed glove incorporates force and temperature sensors to capture grip strength and temperature readings respectively. These sensors transmit data through the MQTT protocol, enabling real-time monitoring of the individual's grip strength and temperature sensing abilities. The glove also features finger bands that pull back when excessive pressure is applied to prevent the individual from breaking objects. In addition, a temperature sensor embedded in the index finger triggers a motor to retract the fingers when a hot object is detected, thus preventing any potential burns.

The proposed glove has significant potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with neurological disorders, providing them with the means to perform daily tasks with greater ease and confidence. The device could be used in rehabilitation settings to monitor and improve grip strength and temperature sensing abilities, and may also be adapted for use in other contexts such as occupational therapy and sports rehabilitation.
