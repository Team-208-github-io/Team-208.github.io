**Description:**
* The team schematic has been broken into sections to reduce confusion\. There are six major sections in the team system\. These are the switching voltage regulator, temperature sensor, LED array, motor driver, force sensors, and the microcontroller\. Each section has arrows on the end of wires that connect to other sections\. These arrows indicate the exact pin that wire should connect to\. THe motor driver uses SPI to connect and communicate with the motor allwoing for bi-directional movement\. I2C is used by the temperature sensors to communicate back towards the PCB\. 

* We decided to place all of our components into a 3D printed box\. Wires connecting to the PCB will come out of the box and will connect to the motor resting on top of the user's hands\. When the force sensors detect that the user is applying to much force to an object the motors will activate causing  the wries to pull the user's fingers back and prevent any damage to the object\. The box is desinged to be portable, weighing about 2-3 lbs and can be hung on a user's belt or pants, similar to a phone holder\. The glove itsef will be made of stretchy material to fit a variety of hand sizes\. 

Our design is a lightweight, compact glove, that can be worn by anybody suffering from motor neuron diseases, allowing for them to have a degree of independendce and freedom so they can enjoy life to the fullest\.
