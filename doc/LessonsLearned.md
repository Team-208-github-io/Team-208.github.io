1.It is crucial to conduct a thorough review of the data sheets, to ensure that the designated microcontroller is compatible with the intended circuit voltage level for programming purposes.

2. In the event that one encounters challenges in implementing their proposed schematic on a breadboard, it may be prudent to evaluate the circuit's feasibility through utilization of a computer simulation, in order to confirm its functionality.

3. Prior to fabricating a team PCB, it is essential to ascertain that every individual subsystem has been assembled accurately and possesses the capability to endure the necessary voltage, without encountering any short circuit.


4. At times, it may be more effective to simplify a circuit as a means of detecting any possible errors that could impede the proper functioning of the system.


5. Maintaining accurate documentation of all modifications made to both individual and team schematics is critical to assessing the effectiveness of each change.


6. Thorough documentation of all alterations performed on components and code is equally vital for determining the reasons behind their success or failure in realizing the design implementation.


7. To account for any potential design or soldering errors that may arise, it is advisable to procure supplementary components, thereby ensuring the availability of replacements for any damaged or missing parts.


8. It is imperative to document all successful application testing via video recording, as a precautionary measure in the event of any future malfunction or breakdown. This approach provides tangible evidence of the successful implementation of the design.
