Datasheets should be read in full before buying/selecting a component.
If possible computer simulations of circuits should be used before a prototype is made.
Complexity is a killer, keep it simple.
Documnet, documnet, document!!!! Keep records of all changes you make to your PCB if errors occur and parts don't work
Order more parts than you think you'll need.
Video something everytime you successfully test. Parts will break the morning you need them most.
